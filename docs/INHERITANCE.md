In Rust, there is no direct concept of inheritance as in languages like Python or Java. Rust uses a system of traits and composition to provide similar functionality.

Here's an example of how you might translate the `Transform` class from Python to Rust using traits:

```rust
pub trait Transform {
    fn new() -> Self;
    fn set_label(&mut self, label: String);
    fn add_child(&mut self, child: Box<dyn Transform>);
    fn call(&mut self, input: Option<Vec<String>>) -> Vec<String>;
    fn expand(&self, input_or_inputs: Vec<String>) -> Vec<String>;
}

pub struct MyTransform {
    children: Vec<Box<dyn Transform>>,
    label: String,
}

impl Transform for MyTransform {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            children: Vec::new(),
            label: String::from("Transform"),
        }
    }

    fn set_label(&mut self, label: String) {
        self.label = label;
    }

    fn add_child(&mut self, child: Box<dyn Transform>) {
        self.children.push(child);
    }

    fn call(&mut self, input: Option<Vec<String>>) -> Vec<String> {
        // Implement the logic here
        Vec::new()
    }

    fn expand(&self, input_or_inputs: Vec<String>) -> Vec<String> {
        // Implement the logic here
        Vec::new()
    }
}
```

In this example, `Transform` is a trait that defines a common interface for all types that implement it. `MyTransform` is a struct that implements the `Transform` trait. You can create other structs that implement the `Transform` trait to create different kinds of transforms.

This is a basic translation and may not cover all the functionality of your Python class. For example, the `__call__` and `expand` methods are not implemented because their functionality is not clear from the provided Python code. You may need to adjust this code to fit your specific needs.
